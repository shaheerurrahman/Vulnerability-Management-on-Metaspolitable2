# Vulnerability-Management-on-Metaspolitable2
## Overview :bar_chart:

### What is Nessus? <br>
Nessus is a platform developed by Tenable that scans for security vulnerabilities in devices, applications, operating systems, cloud services and other network resources.

Nessus encompasses several products that automate point-in-time vulnerability assessments of a network's attack surface, with the goal of enabling enterprise IT teams to stay ahead of cyber attackers by proactively identifying and fixing vulnerabilities as the tool discovers them, rather than after attackers exploit them.
Nessus identifies software flaws, missing patches, malware, denial-of-service vulnerabilities, default passwords and misconfiguration errors, among other potential flaws. When Nessus discovers vulnerabilities, it issues an alert that IT teams can then investigate and determine what -- if any -- further action is required. <br>
